## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS 

### What I learned

Not much this time around. On the contrary, I feel like I was not creative enough to come up with a cool animation/transition for changing slides.

### Continued development

I would like to explore ways to implement cooler visual effects for switching slides. I would also like to figure out ways to make the site more responsive, especiallywith my absolutely positiones buttons.
